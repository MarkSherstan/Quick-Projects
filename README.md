## Projects Under Development

### Laser Tracker
The goal of this project is to detect motion with a webcam and accurately track the movement with a laser pointer in 2 dimensions.

### Mint Automation
[Mint](https://www.mint.com) is a free online budget tracker, however some banks do not allow Mint to automatically pull data. This code automates manually inputting transactions from a downloaded .csv file. Check out the [README](https://github.com/MarkSherstan/Quick-Projects/tree/master/mintAutomation) for more information.


## Continuously Updated Projects

* [Servo Motor Serial Port Controller](https://github.com/MarkSherstan/Quick-Projects/tree/master/PWM/servoSerial)

### 37 in 1 Sensor Kit + Others
Writing examples for various sensors as I use them. Code can be found [here](https://github.com/MarkSherstan/Quick-Projects/tree/master/37in1sensorKit). The majority of the sensors are from the kit located [here](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01BY16552/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

### OpenCV
Functions for testing computer vision and image processing primarily with OpenCV Python and hopefully C++ in the future.
* [HSV Real Time Color Slider](https://github.com/MarkSherstan/Quick-Projects/blob/master/OpenCV/Python/HSVslider.py)
